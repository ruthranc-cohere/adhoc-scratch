       " Here is the cleaned-up call transcription:<br><br>Thank you for choosing Cohere Health. If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 911. <br><br>Hello?<br>Yes. Good afternoon. Dr. Khan calling from Cohere Health for Dr. Watson.<br>Okay, someone's gonna go grab her. She is coming, okay? She was in the middle of a procedure.<br>I understand. Thank you.<br><br>Hello, this is Dr. N. Watson.<br>Dr. Watson, good afternoon, Dr. Khan calling from Cohere Health, how are you today?<br>Good. How are you?<br>Good. I'm a board certified physiatrist and pain management specialist, calling on a recorded line about Charles French. Date of birth, October 31, 1956. We have your request for the spinal cord stimulator trial, but within the notes submitted by your office, there are some gaps that we want to try to fill in to see if we can get this approved.<br>Correct. <br><br>So the first thing I just wanted to mention to you is I understand this is for cervical spine. However, your staff coded this submission for lumbar radiculopathy. I did find the cervical spine ICD-10 code in the note, but in the future just to ensure that they should understand we need the correct ICD-10 code.<br>Okay.<br><br>Beyond that, I need to go over a couple of other things with you. The note says the patient had a prior surgical fusion, with no details and we have no imaging results. So we really don't know anything about his cervical spine anatomically, except that he was in an automobile accident four months ago and had an C3 fracture. Can you tell us about that prior surgery?<br><br>Yes, I'm looking at it. He had seen a nerve surgeon down in Myrtle Beach at a different office. <br><br>Who referred him back?<br><br>Doctor, any chance you could be a little closer to the speaker phone? It's a little bit difficult for me to hear you. Thank you.<br><br>Okay, alright, here we are. So he was referred by Dr. Giddons, a neurosurgeon, for a stimulator trial for cervical spine. Prior to that, I was...<br><br>Okay, so that answers one question, because it says referred by Giddons for SCS, but of course we have no idea who that is and what their qualifications are. Is he the same neurosurgeon who treated the patient for the cervical spine fracture?<br><br>I assume so. <br><br>Another words, okay, so...<br><br>What I'm unclear about is the following and, and, let me be completely transparent, the patient had a prior cervical fusion. He's been treated for chronic neck pain. He then has an MVA four months ago, fractures his neck. We don't know if the patient's a surgical candidate, we don't know if the patient's been seen by a neurosurgeon and we're trying to kind of cobble everything together. So is it reasonable to assume that he's not a surgical candidate? Because the neurosurgeon made the referral for SCS.<br><br>Right. Correct.<br><br>Okay, so that helps answer that question we still don't know. What the fusion was, or at what level was the fusion related to the MVA four months ago, or was it remote and prior to that? <br><br>Remote. It was remote.<br><br>Okay. <br><br>So we'll done remotely years ago. Okay, do you have any cervical imaging results on this patient?<br><br>Yes, I have that we did. An X-ray? <br><br>Since June 8 when he fractured his neck.<br><br>And here's the reason why I asked that. We don't know why for sure without the neurosurgical consult, and certainly without the imaging, why he has chronic neck pain into his shoulders. For all I know, he's got a disk and told the surgeon he doesn't want surgery. We really don't know.<br><br>Sure. Right. Sure. <br><br>And that becomes an issue. Because as you probably know, under Medicare, spinal cord stimulators have to be the last resort. So to be the last resort, we have to ensure that there are no other potential treatments that have been left undone.<br><br>So let me get...<br><br>Right. <br><br>So, that's gonna take me to my next question.<br><br>Correct.<br><br>There's a note that says he had a cervical RFA in August 1980. Percent relief. And your note of 9/12 says he's here today for repeat bilateral cervical ablation. <br><br>Where is the history of present illness? You're reading that?<br><br>Yeah, let me find that for you, cuz I should be able to find it fairly quickly.<br><br>Cuz in the the 9/12 note I'm reading from the top. Most recent cervical RFA done was 8/3/2022 with 80 percent relief. <br><br>Well, let me get you down to assessment and plan. <br><br>Go to number two cervical spondylosis. Kang did ablation 3/20/2023. What I don't know because beneath it, it says most recent RFA cervical, done 8/3/22 gave 80 percent relief of pain of 10. Here for repeat bilateral cervical ablation.<br><br>Okay, that was a missed print from my PA. <br><br>Which does raise an interesting question though. <br><br>Has this patient subsequent to his cervical fracture four months ago. Had any pain management treatment, because, I think it's reasonable to assume that an C3 fracture after an MVA can aggravate chronic neck pain, and so, therefore, we'd want to know has he had any injections or an RFA done since that date. Because it seems to me the last interventional procedure he had that we have a date for at least was over two years ago.<br><br>He had a cervical RFA prior to his motor vehicle accident on 4/30/2024, on the right side. Okay, prior to that, it was again right side August 23. <br><br>Okay, the patient's complaining though of chronic cervical pain going to both shoulders, suggesting his symptoms are bilateral. Has he had any interventional pain management done since the C3 fracture that was incurred during the MVA four months ago?<br><br>Because that's kind of like restarting the clock so to speak. I'm sure you can understand what I'm saying. You have a traumatic etiology of your pain, so now we have to treat the traumatic etiology of your pain and whether he was in an Aspen collar, a soft collar or both. We need to know what was done above and beyond that.<br><br>Correct. Sure, sure, right.<br><br>Right. Sure. <br><br>The other question that I would ask in that same vein. Would be. Has he had any PT, home exercises since the motor vehicle accident, again, as a measure of treatment modality to try to treat what's acute on chronic neck pain presumably?<br><br>Not ordered by this office. <br><br>Okay, so it's possible, but we don't know.<br><br>Correct. There's no mention of it that he was in physical therapy with the nurse.<br><br>In other words, we don't know what kind of care he received, right, we don't know what kind of care he received under the care of the neurosurgeon who may have been most concerned about just immobilizing his neck to let the fracture heal and nothing else was done.<br><br>Correct.<br><br>Okay, so with that in mind, my sense of all of this is. We are not at that point without getting a little bit more clarity, or a little bit more treatment that the use of the stimulator is the latest or last result, or resort, I should say for chronic intractable pain. Maybe getting some more information from the neurosurgeon would clarify that, and potentially may then lead to potentially more treatment that he needs before he would really qualify. At least, that would be my take on this.<br><br>With that in mind, I would suggest that at this point in time I don't think we can go ahead and approve this because of the missing information which would leave you with the options of either withdrawing the request, pursuing everything we just discussed or giving you what's called denial. With appeal rights, you then appeal it directly to the carrier who's Humana. But on appeal, they're going to have the right to ask you every single question that I just asked you, and if those are not satisfied and they don't overturn it on appeal, then you have to wait another 60 days before you can submit that same request for another spinal cord stimulator. <br><br>Okay, so I would - I would just withdraw it. Yeah, I would withdraw it.<br><br>So given the choice between what, okay, go ahead, please. Okay, alright, alright, so I'll withdraw it on behalf of the office. We've kind of gone over a laundry list of things we need to know about what was his prior fusion, what are his current imaging results? Is he a surgical candidate or did he just refuse surgery but I think we'd still like to know what he told. He is a surgical candidate but doesn't want it. Versus saying you're not a surgical candidate. Has he had any physical therapy and or home exercise, and has he had any injection procedures to try to treat the pain. I think once that's all clarified, whether either by it's all been done already. We just need the notes or you have to intervene and do some of those things. Then, I think it's an appropriate time to resubmit a new request if all of that has failed. Alright, with that in mind, I'll go ahead and withdraw this on behalf of your office and then we'll look forward to that next submission. Whenever the appropriate time is upon us, alright?<br><br>Sure. Okay, alright, sounds fair. Thank you.<br><br>You're welcome, thanks. Okay, thank you, Dr. Alright. Have a good day, bye bye."

    "And last initial is? I'm sorry, last initial is Eight.\n",
    "Ok, thank you, miss susan. And may I also have a good phone number, our call back number for you?\n",
    "864-512-4526.\n",
    "Ok. And just to verify that was 864-512-4526. Is that correct?\n",
    "That is correct.\n",
    "Ok. And which health plan are you calling in reference to Today?\n",
    "Humana?\n",
    "And are you calling on behalf of the ordering or performing provider?\n",
    "The ordering and performing.\n",
    "Ok. And also just to verify yes, ma'am.\n",
    "And let me just tell you right quick before let me tell you right quick while I'm calling. Before we go on, my doctor did appear, appear Yesterday with One of your docs and the doctor that he did the peer to peer with, denied, One of my procedure codes but he approved the other Two now in the website on the website it got that y'all have someone has with, drown it and I need the.\n",
    "I need the authorization number for the Two code that he approved. But somebody had I got, like I said withdrawn it.\n",
    "Ok. Could you provide me with the tracking number you're calling in reference to?\n",
    "Yes, ma'am, I can it is R as in randy, T as in tony, I as in igloo, C as in Charlie lost thing 8773?\n",
    "Ok. And just to verify that was R, T, I, C 8773. Correct?\n",
    "That is great.\n",
    "And could you verify the member's name and date of birth?\n",
    "It is Carl rollins 10 27 55.\n",
    "Ok.\n",
    "Bear, bear with me. One moment. Let me review the notes on the account, ok?\n",
    "Yes, ma'am, ok.\n",
    "Ok, bear with me One moment. I'm still here, so that was 936-539-3656.\n",
    "Yes, ma'am?\n",
    "Ok, I just want to make sure so it looks like with the\n",
    "He?\n",
    "Ok, so for the Two C, P, T codes that were able to be approved, the 936-569-3653. For that one code that could not be approved, a new authorization had to be submitted, so that was submitted, and it is approved. If you would like, I can provide you with the uten Tracking ID number, so the withdrawn case yes, ma'am. That withdrawn case is due to that One code that could not be approved, so the new Tracking ID. I'm sorry. The new option number is 195-370-999.\n",
    "That would be great, ok?\n",
    "Again, that was 195-370-999. And if you would like that Tracking ID number as well is G T, A, R 1391, so G T A R 1391.\n",
    "Ok.\n",
    "And the dates of services 86 of 24 until 96 24 for C, P, C code 936-569-3653.\n",
    "Ok.\n",
    "So when I go in here and look at my at the?\n",
    "The website? Should I not be able to see that?\n",
    "Yes, ma'am you?\n",
    "Sometimes, if you are not the person, yes, ma'am, the one that was previously withdrawn. That's the one you're able to see correct. Sometimes, if you are not the person that submitted the authorization via the portal, you would need to look it up by clicking on start authorquest and entering the members, I, D and date of birth, and then click on patient summary.\n",
    "Cuz, I've seen the one where that seen it.\n",
    "Go ahead, I'm sorry.\n",
    "Yeah.\n",
    "Yeah, and I am. I am the yeah, I'm sorry. I am the one that I'm sorry. I am the one that did the authorization, I did it. And I can see you know the withdraw one and because I did do it myself and I actually went in there. And the old one, the one that was withdrawn. I went in there and tried to remove the 33340 so I could, you know would be able to use that. But then I seen the the withdrawn thing but does it take it little while for it to upload or because I'm still not seeing it?\n",
    "Ok.\n",
    "No ma'am, who no ma'am, whoever updated the authorization due to that C, P, T code not being able to be removed from the request. The reason you're not able to see it is because a new submission was done so like I said, it was submitted by us on our end. So, with it being resubmitted and a new authorization being submitted, you would click on start a request to answer the members, I, D, and date of birth, to pull up the patients to view all of the authorizations that the member has on file, versus just the ones that you submitted. To see the one that I'm referencing to.\n",
    "Ok, so that's usually a place that I can put the new tracking number in as well. Where would I do that? Because, I usually can.\n",
    "Yes, ma'am on the dashboard. If you enter it on the dashboard, it may pull up just in the event that it doesn't, you would need to do it. The additional way, start a request to answer the I D and date of birth, but you can try enter it on the dashboard. Click on Cohere health, and that'll take you back to the dashboard and in that search bar, inter that Tracking ID number that was provided.\n",
    "Ok, I can right there. Ok. Thank you so much for your help, marcia, and you have a wonderful rest of your Day.\n",
    "You're more than welcome, and just to verify if there anything else I can assist you with Today.\n",
    "No, ma'am. I thank you for all of your help.\n",
    "You're welcome, and thank you for calling Cohere help you. Have a great day if there's nothing more than I can assist you with?\n",
    "You as well. Bye bye.\n",
